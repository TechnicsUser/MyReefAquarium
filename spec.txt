***************** Hardware ***************** 

Arduino mega / node mcu
3.2" tft lcd with sd
ds 1307 for time with battery backup
8 original relay board
8 ss relay board 
relays conected through shift register

***************** Software ***************** 

Planned features for the controller:


1. LED control
	- 1-6 individually controlled channels (#6 reserved for moonlight)
	- Moonlight feature based on location and date/time
	- Dimming trough PWM using Mean Well ELN-xx-xx drivers
	- Sunrise & sunset modes
	- Storm mode (?)
	- Light dimming based on temperature in tank
		- Automatically dim lights -25% if temp over X
		- Automatically dim lights -50% if temp over X +1
		- Automatically dim lights -75% if temp over X +2
		- Automatically dim lights -100% if temp over X +4
	

2. Environment monitoring
	- Temperature monitoring using 1-wire Dallas DS1820 probes (1-n readings)
	- Temperature & humidity monitoring usin DTH11 or DTH22 probes
	- pH monitoring
	- ORP monitoring
	- Conductivity monitoring

	
3. Pump control
	- Support for Tunze electronic pumps (1-10V)
	- Support for Jaebo WP40 and WP25 pumps (1-5V)
	- Pre defined flow patterns (copied from Ecotech)
		- Tidal Swell Mode
		- Nutrient Transport Mode
		- Reef Crest Mode
		- Lagoonal Mode
		- Short Pulse (0,5s | 1s)
		- Long Pulse (2s | 3s | 5s | 10s)
	- User configurable modes


4. Heater control
	- Connected to DB1820 probes utilizing relay switches
	- if temp > x relay(LOW);
	- if temp < x relay(HIGH);


5. Fan control
	- Fan on if temperature rises above set value in tank (DS1820)
	- Fan on if humidity rises over set value in cabinet (DTH11/22)
	

6. ATO monitoring
	- Float switches to monitor water level in tank/sump
	- Monitoring amount of water in ATO tank


7. Web interface for monitoring and setup
	- Login
	- Current status
		- Temperatures
		- pH, ORP, Conductivity
		- LED status (on/off, intesivity% per channel)
		- Pump status (mode/power)
		- Heater status (on/off)
		- Fan status (on/off)
	- LED setup
		- Adjust lights timing and power
	- Pump setup
		- Adjust modes


8. LCD display
	- Support for 1602, 2004 and TFT LCD (320x240px) displays
	- Button support for navigation and setups
	- Touch support for navigation and setups

9. Notifications
	-sound beep depending on error
	-email warnings
	-text serious errors








100. Video (openCv)
	use kinnect for live video streaming and growth monitoring
